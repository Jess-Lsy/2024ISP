    </main>
    <div id="context">
        <p>Within the economic and political contexts of the trade linking Dandong, China, and Sinuiju, North Korea, this ethnographic research project looks 
            at the various multilingual signage along two intercrossing streets—Shiwei Rd and Erjing St. This cross-section holds major business offices near 
            the city’s Customs House that deals with trade and investment on both sides of the border, as well as “Chosun Streets”, which is composed mainly 
            of service-oriented local businesses established by Dandong’s longtime ethnic Korean Chinese residents. Notably, These confined areas are where 
            about a quarter of the DPRK’s external economic trade is handled, and is a major center of the DPRK’s legal/illegal trade conducted under cover 
            of Chinese relative freedom. Within these unique contexts emerge distinctive lived experiences, narratives, and dialogues, that are reflected 
            within its language use. By visualizing the data collected from 800+ signages within the past decade. The goal is to invite the viewer to partake 
            in an interactive journey of exploring this unique and complex intersection of contexts, explore the ways in which broader systems, factors, and 
            influences are reflected in these visual components, and then bring these reflections into our own, or other similar spaces.
