      <h1>Context</h1>
      <h3>Dandong(丹东), which directly translates to "the Red East", is a Chinese city that shares mountains, rivers, and cultural ties with North Korea, one footstep away. </h3>
        <h3> From witnessing the forefront of Japanese Colonization, to its involvement in the Korean War, to now handling beyond 25% of North Korea’s external economic trade, 
        we can see traces of history in physical form.</h3>

        <img src="img/1x/yalujiang1.png" style="width: 600px; padding-top: 20px;">
        <h3>Sitting at the edge, the city has been a strong advocate for economic growth as peace building.</h3>

        <h3>To commemorate the “successful resistance against US aggression and aid towards North Korea” in 1953, a commercialized area called Chosun Streets was established. </h3>

        <h3>Here is the DPRK consulate, plus many business offices—North Korean, joint-venture and Chinese—aiming to deal with trade and investment on both sides of the border. 
        Majority of residents nearby are of Korean Ethnic minority group, as well as many North Koreans, who do not live in factory provided dormitories.</h3>

        <h3>In these confined areas is a major centre of the DPRK’s legal/illegal trade conducted under cover of Chinese relative freedom, described in a 2020 report as a 7 billion dollar border. </h3>

        <h3>Korean is heard more than Chinese in this part of the city, and the streets are full of Korean restaurants, grocery stores, electronic and household goods shops, trade offices and translation service offices. </h3>

      <h1>Renaming the Memorial Archway</h1>
      <h3>Between 2016 and 2014, the Memorial Archway’s sign lettering changed from “North & South Korean Styled Streets” to “Goryeo Streets”. </h3>
      <h3>From a Modern separate name to an old and inclusive name</h3>
    </div>
    
    <div id="chapter3" style="padding-top: 400px;">
      <h1>Change in Character Count</h1>
      <h3>2013 marked peak of Dandong’s gross regional domestic product.

        The DPRK has failed to complete the modern four-lane cross-river bridge built by the Chinese in 2014, fearing complete economic penetration.
        
        2015-2017, a series of United Nations Security council sanctions were added, making nearly all DPRK exports illegal, backed by secondary US 
        Treasury sanctions virtually freezing all FX exchange between China and the DPRK through the banking system and sanctioned Dandong Enterprises. 
        Seafood, agricultural produce, coal, iron, steel, machinery, textiles could now only be handled by smugglers.  UNSC bans on exports to North Korea 
        were supposed to prevent almost everything except agricultural products from leaving China. 
        
        By 2017, the Port of Dandong was bankrupt.
        
        Dandong Port Company defaulted on bonds in 2017, becoming further indepted in 2018
        
        Workers formerly subcontracted by Dandong in the clothing business returned to the country side in 2018

      <h1>From "TEL" to an Icon</h1>
      <h3>In 2016, ?% of the stores replaced “TEL” with a phone icon instead. Though it is unknown how that decision was made and implemented, it could be 
        viewed as an act of redefining a universal language through iconography, or a preference of less use of alphabetic characters in their cohesive identity. </h3>

      <h1>Analyzing the Semantics of Public Service Announcements</h2>
        <h3>Construction Hoardings (the panels that surround a construction site) is often used as a space for public service announcements and commercial advertisement. There has been three versions throughout the decade, each reflecting the societal values at the time. 
  
          2014:
          “Focusing closely on building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, accelerate the construction of a new and beautiful Dandong.“
          
          Create a national level civilized city. Civilization starts with small gestures, cities rise from small actions. 
          
          Create a national level hygienic city. Create a piece of purified land, share a piece of blue sky. 
          
          Create a national level landscape city. Let the earth be full of vitality, let our homes be filled with greenery. 
          
          Create a national level environmentalist model city. Protect our environment, love our home, live a healthy life every day. 
          
          Emphasis on themes such as prosperty, civilness, and enviromentalism, where we are looking for economic growth while respecting each other and the shared environment that is home. 
          
          2016-2018:
          
          “Rejoice and dance towards that dream. With much luck and longevity, May you be hardworking and kind-hearted. Chinese spirit, Chinese image, Chinese culture, Chinese expression. Filial piety to Chinese people. Cherish the grain grains and return them to the warehouse. Chinese dream from generation to generation. On the road to dreams. The world is at home/I am old and I am old/I am happy on the way to my dream/Public service announcements about civilization and new trends”
          
          Beyond the general advocacy towards”the Chinese Dream”, there is an emphasis on cultural traditions and values such as filial piety, an attitude of respect for elders, parents and ancestors, and cherishing the food on our plates. 
          
          2024:
          
          “Architecture and green symbiotic development and ecological coordination; Hongli Group, a model private enterprise, has a diversified layout and is deeply involved in Dandong; it promotes the spirit of craftsman and strives to reach the peak of quality; integrity is the basis and service is the root; scientific management is efficient and high quality; it follows the pulse of the city to build a better life; a century-old apartment, Wealth is gathered; caring for growth, everyone fulfills their responsibilities, enriching the people and strengthening the country is passed down from generation to generation -; garbage classification is not implemented, safe travel does not violate regulations; participate in the establishment of safety, create a harmonious atmosphere; strive for a hundred years, set sail on a new journey; create a civilized city, build harmony Dandong; once a century-old apartment, popularity gathers; once a century-old apartment, ——hua gathers;——————. The prime location in the heart of Dandong City. The built-up area is about 35-85m2. Top-level Jinling Private Apartment/Civilized Dandong Wen Ming Dan Dong”
          
          Though enmeshed with its real estate advertisement purposes, it is implied that this neighborhood is a central and prosporous area that is worth investing in and be inherited by future generations. Along with its building, it is also advertising a “high quality life style” based on a prosperous society in all aspects.

    <div id="chapter6" style="padding-left: 950px; padding-top: 400px;">
      <h1>Modernization of Style</h1>
      <h3>Both natural wear and tear of the signage or a new building regulation could ask for a redesign for the storefront. WIthin the shops that remain, some chose to simplify their designs by decreasing the use of color, amount of type heirarchy, visual and photographic elements, as well as dimensionality. The material used to construct these signs also tend to be stretched canvas??  </h3>

    <div id="chapter7">
      <h1>Fourth and Fifth Languages</h1>
      <h3>Despite the use of “TEL” has been largely replaced by the universal telephone icon, the total English word count has increased in the past 4 years. This growth mostly comes from the English translation of store/brand names. Such as “Mr.Yao” or “Tasly Pharmacy” or “The Jewlery”. However, that word count also includes 5 instances of “Ma Chang Dong” appearing within the same sign, which provides the visual aesthetic of alphabetic letters, which most language speakers would be able to read, but not necessarily infer meaning from. “David & Bella” along with white children pictured </h3>
